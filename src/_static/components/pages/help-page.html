                    The Code for Africa StoryLab Academy has been designed primarily to teach digital skills to working journalists. If you’re just starting out in your career, you may find the entire program useful. If you’ve already got some experience under your belt, the advanced courses will teach you new skills and the rest can help as a refresher.

                    It’s not just journalists who will benefit from StoryLab Academy, though. The research and communication skills will also help NGOs, activists and more.

                    StoryLab Academy is a partnership between Code for Africa, Google News Lab and the World Bank. Many of the lessons are drawn from existing courses developed by Google News Lab and the World Bank, but customised for journalists operating across Africa with local content and techniques specific to the particular challenges they face.

                    Anyone can sign up for a StoryLab Academy course, but we strongly recommend that if you’re working in a newsroom you contact Code for Africa, who may be able to supplement your online training with face-to-face sessions with a local trainer.

                    The courses in StoryLab Academy have been designed to teach data-driven research and storytelling. In the newsroom world, this is also known as “data-driven journalism”. Modules have been put together to take you all the way from basic online research and digital data gathering, through to storytelling with data visualisations, maps, audio, video and even 360-degree videos.

                    We have built a free certification process into StoryLab Academy, although at present this is not equivalent to a formal diploma or endorsed by a third-party educational establishment. Many of the lessons have been designed by some of the leading online educators from Google and the World bank, however, so you can rest assured the skills you’ll learn will be up-to-date and useful.

                    While we can’t guarantee a job at the end of it, you will learn how to tell your stories more effectively, and with more reliable data, in a way suited to the online world.

                    Definitely not. We recognise that print and radio (and TV) are still the dominant media in Africa. The tools and techniques we teach are put together with digital in mind, but can be used to supplement research and storytelling for any outlet.

                    Yes, the StoryLab Academy holds regular meet ups and training sessions in four key formats:
<br><br>
<b>StoryLab Masterclasses</b>
<br>
These are monthly topic-specific masterclasses led by topic mentors and trainers drawn from a global pool of experts from intercontinental digital media, data journalism, civic media and civic technology networks. The StoryLab Academy Masterclass content is benchmarked on global best-of-breed on specific niche topics around the Academy’s core content, and aims to develop a specific skill-set among participants.
<br><br>
<b>StorySprints</b>
<br>
StorySprints are thematic (across e.g health , education, water, immigration, pandemics, etc. ). They are held on a project by project, story by story basis, and provide the space and time for journalist teams to make headway on their stories or projects through a rapid iteration / rapid prototyping approach to publishing data stories / data projects / digital multimedia projects in a short time frame, supported by a t-shaped StoryLab team, which includes a data-editor, a developer, and a designer. The StorySprints team combines deep technical and journalistic expertise with the resources of the local in-country Code for Africa citizen labs.
<br><br>
<b>Newsroom Visits</b>
<br>
A newsroom visit (brown-bag lunch) is an on-site 1.5 hr training on a specific tool (e.g Google Tools , e.g google Public Data Explorer), held in a StoryLab Academy partner newsroom. The minimum class size is 15 people per newsroom.These brown-bag lunch visits are meant to build on specific residual skill-sets in the newsroom and are designed in a gradual learning format that does not overwhelm participants with many tools at a time.
<br><br>
<b>Hacks/Hackers Meetups</b>
<br>
Journalists sometimes call themselves “hacks,” a tongue-in-cheek term for someone who can churn out words in any situation. Hackers use the digital equivalent of duct tape to whip out code.Hacks/Hackers tries to bridge those two worlds by holding monthly meetups led by local pan-African Citizen Labs in Abuja | Cape Town | Casablanca | Dakar | Dar es Salaam | Durban | Freetown | Johannesburg | Kampala | Lagos | Nairobi | Yaounde
